The script_tests.json, tx_invalid.json, and tx_valid.json files in this
directory originally came from the bitcoin project
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

The script_tests.json file has significantly diverged from its original
form to the point it has little resemblance to the original, but several tests
are still intact and thus the license is maintained for those tests.  All
modifications made by the Decred project are released under the ISC Licsense as
detailed below.

The imported tests in script_test.json, tx_invalid.json, and tx_valid.json are
released under the following license:
